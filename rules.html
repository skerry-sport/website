                <h2>1. Purpose and Objectives</h2>
                <p>The Skerry Sport One-Design Class exists to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Promote safe, friendly, and enjoyable racing in boats built from CLC Skerry kits or plans as published by Chesapeake Light Craft (CLC)</li>
                    <li>Provide fair competition where sailing skill outweighs construction differences</li>
                    <li>Support local fleets with consistent rules while allowing for builder creativity within reason</li>
                    <li>Foster community among Skerry Sport sailors through organized events and good sportsmanship</li>
                </ul>

                    <h2>2. Boat Eligibility and Measurement</h2>
                    
                    <h3>2.1 Eligibility</h3>
                    <p>Boats eligible for competition must be substantially similar to the CLC Skerry design as published by CLC. Variations due to home-building are anticipated, but they must not materially affect performance.</p>
                    
                    <h3>2.2 Registration</h3>
                    <p>Each racing boat must register with its fleet and the Association, declaring rig type and providing a record of construction details (materials, modifications, weight corrections, etc.).</p>
                    
                    <h3>2.3 Measurement Certificates</h3>
                    <p>Boats that have passed measurement will receive a certificate of compliance valid until altered by repair or modification.</p>
