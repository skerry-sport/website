                <h2>Welcome to Our New Class</h2>
                <p>The Skerry Sport One-Design Class Association (SSODCA) is a nascent sailing class just getting started. We're excited to bring together owners and sailors of boats built from the CLC Skerry kit or plans as published by Chesapeake Light Craft.</p>
                
                <h3>What is the CLC Skerry?</h3>
                <p>The CLC Skerry is a 15-foot, 4.5-beam double-ended sailboat featuring beautiful glued-lapstrake plywood construction. Available in three rig configurations - Balanced Lug, Sprit, and Sloop - the CLC Skerry offers exciting sailing performance in a package that's accessible to home builders.</p>
                
                <h3>Why Join Our Class?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fair Racing:</strong> Our one-design rules ensure that sailing skill, not boat modifications, determines race results</li>
                    <li><strong>Multiple Rig Options:</strong> Race in Balanced Lug, Sprit, or Sloop configurations with appropriate handicaps</li>
                    <li><strong>Builder-Friendly:</strong> We understand that home-built boats will have natural variations and account for this in our rules</li>
                    <li><strong>Growing Community:</strong> Be part of establishing a new class with sailors who share your passion for these beautiful boats</li>
                </ul>
